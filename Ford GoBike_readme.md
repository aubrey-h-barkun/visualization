# Ford GoBike Exploration
## by Aubrey Hansen-Barkun


## Dataset

The 'Ford GoBike Trip Data' dataset contains information about customer trips in 2017. The dataset contains 519,700 observations of 13 features related to the time/duration of the trips, the location of the trip, and characteristics of the bike used and customer.


## Summary of Findings

1. The distribution of trip durations is roughly log-normal with a mean trip duration of approximately 1,100 seconds or 18.3 minutes
2. Approximately three quarters of all trips are taken by the Subscriber user type, while only one quarter of trips are taken by the non-Subscriber Customer user type
3. The distribution of start times is bimodal, with the peak start times being between 8-9am and 5-6pm (roughly 25% of all starts are in these peaks)
4. San Francisco Ferry Building (Harry Bridges Plaza) is the most popular start station with roughly 3% of all starts
5. There is a larger range of Customer trip durations compared to subscriber trip durations. The median Customer trip duration is roughly 1000 seconds, compared to roughly 500 for Subscribers
6. Trip durations seem to peak with early morning starts, and then fluctuate throughout the remainder of the day
7. Weekend trip durations are longer than weekdays for nearly every start time 


## Key Insights for Presentation

1. The trip duration thread will be central to the final presentation. The log-normal distribution will be displayed, and the relationship between user type, time of day, and weekday will be highlighted
